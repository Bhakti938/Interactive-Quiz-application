This task involved designing and implementing a fully functional interactive quiz application using core frontend technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface where users can answer a series of questions and receive instant feedback on their performance.

The quiz application features multiple-choice questions that are dynamically loaded into the interface, ensuring that users experience smooth interaction throughout the test. When a user selects an option and submits their answer, the app immediately highlights the correct answer and provides instant feedback. This real-time feedback loop enhances the learning experience and simulates the behavior of modern educational platforms.

From a technical perspective, the application leverages JavaScript arrays and objects to store questions and options, DOM manipulation to dynamically render elements, and event listeners to handle user interactions. Scoring logic is implemented to track correct answers, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz. A restart functionality is also included to allow the user to retake the quiz.

Styling is done using responsive CSS to ensure that the interface remains clean and accessible across devices. The application’s design is intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and complete the quiz.

Overall, this task helped reinforce practical knowledge of DOM manipulation, conditional rendering, event handling, and modular code writing — all fundamental skills for a front-end developer. It also emphasized the importance of user experience and accessibility in interface design.
