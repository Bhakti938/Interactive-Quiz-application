The first task of the internship was to build an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of the project was to allow users to attempt multiple-choice questions and get instant feedback along with their final score. This task focused on using core frontend technologies without the help of any external frameworks or libraries.

The quiz application includes a clean user interface where questions are presented one at a time, each having multiple options. The user selects an answer, submits it, and immediately receives feedback indicating whether the selected answer was correct. The app tracks the number of correct answers, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz session. It also includes a restart option, allowing users to retake the quiz anytime.

JavaScript played a major role in this task. It was used to dynamically load questions and options from an array of objects. The DOM was manipulated to show new questions and handle user interactions like button clicks and option selections. The logic behind checking answers, updating the score, and moving to the next question was written using basic JavaScript conditions, loops, and functions.

From a styling perspective, CSS was used to design the layout, color scheme, hover effects, and responsive behavior. The overall look of the quiz is clean and user-friendly, designed to give users a smooth and enjoyable experience across different screen sizes.

This task helped me improve my skills in core JavaScript concepts like functions, arrays, event listeners, conditionals, and DOM manipulation. It also strengthened my understanding of how to design and implement an interactive frontend application that responds to user inputs in real-time. I also learned how to make the user experience more engaging with instant feedback mechanisms.

The experience of building this quiz app was very rewarding. It allowed me to implement logic, handle data, and create a dynamic flow from start to finish. I also learned how to organize code for better readability and maintainability, which is essential in professional development.

Overall, the quiz application was a complete frontend project that combined design, logic, and interactivity. It helped me understand the flow of real-time input and output, how to validate answers, and how to display results in a clean and meaningful way. The project boosted my confidence in using JavaScript effectively and taught me how small projects can greatly enhance understanding of fundamental concepts.
